This is basic Android implementation that uses Google MLKit and DigitalInkRecognizer to do local handwriting recongition from a rasterized Canvas.  
The model is decent for many handwriting styles but has challenges with inconsistent handwriting styles, and connected letters. 
Bespoke models would be advantageous for this siutation.
